# Markdown Will Ultimately Rule Everything

From GPT-3.5 to Gemini 3.1, with the explosion of various Large Language Models (LLMs), model architectures are constantly changing, and technology is continuously evolving. However, amidst all this, one thing has remained constant. Instead of being replaced, it has continuously conquered new territory alongside the LLM boom. It is **Markdown**.

## A Sense of Deja Vu

If you are a frequent user of AI tools, you must have experienced this **deja vu visual experience**:

Whether you open ChatGPT, Gemini, Kimi, or DeepSeek, when you ask them a complex question, the answers they provide are rarely just a long string of dull text. You will see: keywords are **bolded**; steps are clearly marked with numbers or bullet points; and if there's code, it is thoughtfully placed in a code block with a gray background, sometimes even with a "Copy" button in the top right corner.

Their generated structured outputs all share a strikingly consistent formatting style. What is the unsung hero behind this elegant presentation of text in chat windows?

**The answer is: Markdown.**

Markdown is the invisible **winner** of this LLM wave. It is becoming the de facto universal format of the AI era, to the point where even historically stubborn tech giants have started supporting it. For example, Google Docs, Apple Notes, and the venerable Windows Notepad have all quietly added native support for Markdown syntax.

More importantly, **current AI simply cannot do without it**. Almost all LLMs you encounter—no matter which company they come from or what product they run in—default to using Markdown to structure their answers: headings, lists, quotes, code blocks... It is no longer just a writing habit, but a cross-model, cross-platform output protocol.

From geek keyboards to mainstream screens, why Markdown?

## Past and Present

To understand Markdown's position today, we need to go back to the internet of 2004.

**Origin: An "Anti-HTML" Personal Blogging Tool**

In 2004, prominent blogger John Gruber (with the help of the late internet pioneer Aaron Swartz) invented Markdown to write more easily on his blog, *Daring Fireball*.

At the time, writing articles on the web meant manually typing tedious HTML tags (like `<b>` for bolding, or `<p>` for paragraphs). This not only interrupted the flow of writing but also made the resulting source code incredibly hard to read. Gruber wanted a format where, **when read as plain text, it shouldn't look like it's been marked up**.

The name Markdown itself is a playful rebellion against HTML (HyperText **Markup** Language)—you "Mark-up", so I will "Mark-down".

**Why It Succeeded?**

1. **Inheriting "Ancestral Habits" of the Internet:** Markdown's syntax wasn't created out of thin air. In the era of plain text Email, before rich-text emails existed, people had spontaneously formed conventional habits to express emotion and emphasis. For example, using `*emphasis*` or `>` for quoting replies. Markdown astutely captured and standardized these habits, making its learning curve almost zero.
2. **The "View Source" Philosophy:** Just like the early Web, anyone can naturally learn its syntax just by glancing at raw Markdown text; no complex training is required. You don't need to remember where a formatting button is hidden deep in a menu bar; you can complete formatting without your hands leaving the keyboard.
3. **No Intellectual Property (IP) Barriers:** This is a crucial commercial advantage. Markdown was not patented; it was completely free and open. This allowed countless developers to integrate it into their own platforms without hesitation. Later, GitHub established it as the absolute standard in the developer community through GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
4. **The "Default Option" Brought by the Open Source Ecosystem:** After long-term fortification by GitHub, forums, documentation sites, and static site generators, Markdown had already accumulated mature renderers, editors, parsers, and extended syntaxes. So when the first wave of LLM products needed a **universal, renderable, and copiable** output format, there was almost no need to reinvent the wheel—Markdown naturally became the default answer.

**The Destined "Chosen One" of AI**

If the above advantages allowed Markdown to conquer humans, the following characteristics allowed it to completely conquer machines.

1. **The High Signal-to-Noise Ratio of Token Economics:** For LLMs, every character (Token) costs computing power and money. Compared to bloated rich-text code (HTML), JSON, or the underlying XML of Word documents, plain text Markdown consumes the fewest Tokens. It accomplishes structured expression with very few symbols, allowing the model to focus computing power on the "content" itself, rather than meaningless "formatting".
2. **Perfectly Suited for Streaming Output:** AI doesn't give a complete answer all at once; it "spits out" content word by word while thinking. This is called streaming. If you ask an AI to output HTML, it must wait for the final `</table>` or `</div>` closing tag to appear for the whole layout to be valid; an interruption midway causes a complete collapse. Markdown, however, is a linear markup method—if the AI spits out a `#`, the renderer knows the following line is a heading; if it spits out a `-`, it knows a list has started. This natural compatibility is practically tailor-made for the AI era.

## Markdown Will Undoubtedly Rule the World

Good enough + Human/LLM-friendly + A touch of open-source magic ≈ Ruling everything

**"Good Enough" Defeats Perfect**

Today, Markdown's dominance is undeniable, and this is largely due to the explosion of LLMs.

Admittedly, Markdown is not perfect. It suffers from fragmentation caused by various "flavors" and extension syntaxes, and it cannot precisely control complex page layouts like Word or professional typesetting software. However, in the history of technological evolution, "Good Enough" often defeats "Perfect".

It is simple enough, lightweight enough, and cross-platform enough. Most importantly, it perfectly adapts to the streaming output and low-Token consumption scenarios when LLMs generate content. As LLMs penetrate chat windows and productivity tools across all industries, this format is semi-compulsorily pushed to the public, forging its unshakable dominance today.

**The Unexpected Throne**

Turn the clock back to around 2009, when Markdown was just starting to become popular among some programmers and geeks, mainly used for writing project READMEs or static blogs. In that era, who could have imagined that a small tool intended solely to simplify writing HTML would, over a decade later, become the foundational bedrock supporting the multi-trillion-dollar AI industry's interaction with humans?

The fact that it could wait for the massive explosion of the LLM era is entirely due to its completely free, zero-IP open-source nature, as well as the long-term push from the developer ecosystem represented by GitHub.

**Long Live Open Source**

Today, the infrastructure supporting the entire digital world and cutting-edge AI interaction does not come from a grand business plan by Microsoft, Google, or Apple. It is not a closed-loop format designed for monopoly.

It serves as a reminder: the reason the internet can roll forward is often not because a "perfect solution" was designed all at once, but because someone first came up with a crazy idea that "might just work," then released it to the public for everyone to polish and reuse. Just like that, through selfless sharing and iterative refinement time and again, these ideas unknowingly become infrastructure, slowly take over the world, and make life better for more people.

Markdown is a typical product of this modus operandi: it originated from a writer's real pain point 20 years ago, was relayed by the community, amplified by the ecosystem, and ultimately unexpectedly reached the summit in the AI era.

Markdown will ultimately rule everything.
